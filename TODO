a "cancellation" message. a signed "response" that states a host was answered.
this will prevent C from "cheating" and selecting a less-loaded host, AND
reduce some network-chatter.

need a routine to rat out bad hosts that have tried to connect to us,
but didn't actually send any data.

adding transport-layer security wouldn't be too difficult- it's possible
a session key could have already been exchanged (passing the encrypted
session key with the signed-key) but a bit-commitment protocol would be
better.

cservice should handle the bytesex if it's necessary, as it is, all our
x86<->x86 communications do unnecessary transformations. cservice can already
find this out.
