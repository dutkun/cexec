	implementation of a double-barrelled SHA1-driver. both are in the
	public domain.

	these files came from a long lost version of Pegwit that was
	placed into the public domain by George Barwood. They may contain
	code written by Paulo S.L.M. Barreto, or Vincent Rijmen.
	
	The precalculated tables in ec_field.c were altered for the build
	process, and because I abhor typing mixed-case functions, I ran the
	files through the following filter:

	$ perl -p -i -e 's/(cp|vl|gf|ec)([A-Z][a-zA-z]+)/$1."_".lc($2)/seg;'

	There may have been other changes. they are all in the public
	domain.
