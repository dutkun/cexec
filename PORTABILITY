cexec is likely portable to any 32-bit system. it is probably (largely)
portable to 64-bit systems, but might not interoperate in mixed environments.

your milage may vary. changes to support 64-bit and 16-bit systems (and other
such devices) will be accepted.

if your system can manage:
	struct sockaddr_in.sin_port is EXACTLY 16 bits
	struct sockaddr_in.sin_addr is EXACTLY 32 bits
	in_addr_t is EXACTLY 32 bits
	time_t is some size that the system has a built-in type for
	sizeof(time_t) is smaller or equal to a sizeof(long)

AND your build system/headers are C99 compliant, you should be okay.
(if they're not, take a look at the bottom of types.h for help)
